Installing OpenCV for Java
==========================

Introduction to OpenCV for Java
--------------------------------
As of OpenCV 2.4.4, OpenCV supports desktop Java development. This tutorial will help you install OpenCV on your desktop operating system.

Install the latest Java version
--------------------------------
Download the latest Java JDK from the `Oracle <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html>`_ website. Now you should be able to install the latest Java JDK by opening the file just downloaded.

Install the latest Eclipse version
-----------------------------------
Download the latest Eclipse version at the `Eclipse Download page <https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/eclipse-packages/>`_ choosing the ``Eclipse IDE for Java Developers`` version (suggested).

Extract the downloaded compressed file and put the resulting folder wherever you want to. You don't need to install anything. Alternatively, you can try the Eclipse installer.

Install OpenCV 3.x under Windows
------------------------------------
First of all you should download the OpenCV library (version 3.x) from `here <http://opencv.org/releases.html>`_.

Then, extract the downloaded OpenCV file in a location of your choice. Once you get the folder ``opencv`` put in wherever you prefer.

Now the only two things that you will need are: the ``opencv-3xx.jar`` file located at ``\opencv\build\java`` and the ``opencv_java3xx.dll`` library located at ``\opencv\build\java\x64`` (for 64-bit systems) or ``\opencv\build\java\x86`` (for 32-bit systems). The `3xx` suffix of each file is a shortcut for the current OpenCV version, e.g., it will be `300` for OpenCV 3.0 and `330` for OpenCV 3.3. 

Install OpenCV 3.x under macOS
---------------------------------
The quickest way to obtain OpenCV under macOS is to use `Homebrew <http://brew.sh>`_. After installing Homebrew, you have to check whether the `XCode Command Line Tools` are already installed on your system.

To do so, open the `Terminal` and execute:
``xcode-select --install``
If macOS asks for installing such tools, proceed with the download and installation. Otherwise, continue with the OpenCV installation.

As a prerequisite, check that Apache Ant is installed. Otherwise, install it with Homebrew:
``brew install ant``.
Ant should be available at ``/usr/local/bin/ant``.

To install OpenCV (with Java support) through Homebrew, you need to edit the *opencv* formula in Homebrew, to add support for Java:
``brew edit opencv``
In the text editor that will open, change the line:
``-DBUILD_opencv_java=OFF``
in
``-DBUILD_opencv_java=ON``
then, after saving the file, you can effectively install OpenCV:
``brew install --build-from-source opencv``

After the installation of OpenCV, the needed jar file and the dylib library will be located at ``/usr/local/Cellar/opencv/3.x.x/share/OpenCV/java/``, e.g., ``/usr/local/Cellar/opencv/3.3.1/share/OpenCV/java/``.

Please, notice that this method doesn't work if you update OpenCV from a previous version: you need to uninstall OpenCV and install it again.

Install OpenCV 3.x under Linux
---------------------------------
Please, note: the following instructions are also useful if you want to compile OpenCV under Windows or macOS. Linux package management systems (`apt-get`, `yum`, etc.) *may* provide the needed version of the OpenCV library.

As first step, download and install `CMake <http://www.cmake.org/download/>`_ and `Apache Ant <http://ant.apache.org/>`_, if you don't have any of these. Download the OpenCV library from `its website <http://opencv.org/releases.html>`_.
Extract the downloaded OpenCV file in a location of your choice and open CMake ( cmake-gui ).
Put the location of the extracted OpenCV library in the ``Where is the source code field`` (e.g., /opencv/) and insert the destination directory of your build in the ``Where to build the binaries`` field (e.g., /opencv/build).
At last, check the ``Grouped`` and ``Advanced`` checkboxes.

Now press ``Configure`` and use the default compilers for ``Unix Makefiles``. Please, be sure to have installed a C/C++ compiler.
In the ``Ungrouped Entries`` group, insert the path to the Apache Ant executable (e.g., ``/apache-ant-1.9.6/bin/ant``).
In the ``BUILD`` group, unselect:

* ``BUILD_PERF_TESTS``
* ``BUILD_SHARED_LIBRARY`` to make the Java bindings dynamic library all-sufficient
* ``BUILD_TESTS``
* ``BUILD_opencv_python``

In the ``CMAKE`` group, set to ``Debug`` (or ``Release``) the ``CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE``

In the ``JAVA`` group:

* insert the Java AWT include path (e.g., ``/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0/include/``)
* insert the Java AWT library path (e.g., ``/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0/include/jawt.h``)
* insert the Java include path (e.g., ``/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0/include/``)
* insert the alternative Java include path (e.g., ``/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0/include/linux``)
* insert the JVM  library path (e.g., ``/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0/include/jni.h``)

Press ``Configure`` twice, and the CMake window should appear with a white background. If not, fix the red lines and press ``Configure`` again. Now, press ``Generate`` and close CMake.

Now open the terminal, go to the ``build`` folder of OpenCV and compile everything with the command: ``make -j``. Notice that the `-j` flag tells `make` to run in parallel with the maximum number of allowed job threads, which makes the build theoretically faster.
Wait for the process to be completed...
If everything went well you should have ``opencv-3xx.jar`` in the ``/opencv/build/bin`` directory and ``libopencv_java3xx.so`` in the ``/opencv/build/lib`` directory. The `3xx` suffix of each file is a shortcut for the current OpenCV version, e.g., it will be `300` for OpenCV 3.0 and `330` for OpenCV 3.3. This is everything you need.

Set up OpenCV for Java in Eclipse
----------------------------------
Open Eclipse and select a workspace of your choice. Create a User Library, ready to be used on all your next projects: go to  ``Window > Preferences...``.

.. image:: _static/01 - 02.png

From the menu navigate under ``Java > Build Path > User Libraries`` and choose ``New...``.
Enter a name for the library (e.g., opencv) and select the newly created user library.
Choose ``Add External JARs...``, browse to select ``opencv-3xx.jar`` from your computer.
After adding the jar, extend it, select ``Native library location`` and press ``Edit...``.

Select ``External Folder...`` and browse to select the folder containing the OpenCV libraries (e.g., ``C:\opencv\build\java\x64`` under Windows).

In case of MacOS, if you installed OpenCV *without* Homebrew, you need to create a soft link with .dylib extension for the .so file. E.g., from the terminal, type:
``ln -s libopencv_java300.so libopencv_java300.dylib``

Set up OpenCV for Java in other IDEs (experimental)
---------------------------------------------------
If you are using IntelliJ, you can specify the location of the library with the VM argument ``-Djava.library.path=/opencv/build/lib``.
